					The first time I ever worked with html was in my sophomore year of highschool, six years ago.  HTML has been my main choice for writing mark-up ever since, and I have learned a lot about all the amazing features that it makes available.  With HTML5, I have learned how to create clear, semantic web pages that allow displaying media beautifly with canvas and SVG features.

					With CSS, you can style web pages to your heart's content.  I have had 3 years of experience writing organized CSS.  Ever since CSS3 has gained more support from web browsers, making smooth animations to complement content has been a lot easier.  Although vanilla CSS is great on its own, I often use SASS and LESS pre-processors and frameworks such as Zurb Foundation and Bootstrap to make my code more organized and efficient.

					Stylish and well-structured web pages are crucial to a site's appearance, but they don't have to be the only things that make a site.  With JavaScript and the many available libraries such as JQuery, Backbone.js, and AngularJS, I can create more engaging websites that manipulated data and allow users to interact with the content being viewed.
